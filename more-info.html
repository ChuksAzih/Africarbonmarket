            <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">What you need to know about Offset and Carbon Savings</h2>
            <h3>
        
                The key issue about projects for carbon offset is to ensure that the scheme being funded achieves the carbon
                savings
                promised. This requires both the effectiveness of the project at soaking up CO2 or avoiding future emissions and
                the
                additionality of the carbon savings progressively.
        
                The challenge is to to prove additionality over the life cycle of a project beyond its baseline with absolute
                certainly, as one may be unsure of future developments with the project or certain of the alternative scenario
                without the project in existence.
        
                Offset providers must therefore also provide guarantee for their emissions savings through another project to
                cover
                any case of emerging loss of savings due to non-additionality of counts.
                <hr>
                <p> Offset Market Approaches
                <p>
                    1. Offset companies could mobilize enough capital to invest in projects for offset speculative sales by
                    funding an
                    offset project to sell its carbon savings when certified. This helps to predict future dynamics of savings
                    additionality– and claims of emissions value depreciation over the lifecycle of the project.
                </p>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Carbon Market Certification Standards –
                <p>
                    1. Voluntary Gold Standards – based on the Kyoto protocol, and must also show social benefits for local
                    communities
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Voluntary Carbon Standards – it also follows a rigorous but simplified process, thereby allowing a
                    greater range
                    of innovative small-scale projects.
                </p>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p> Price and Estimation of carbon offset
                <p>
                    1. There are various ways of estimating the precise impact of project carbon savings on climate change for
                    certain
                    types of activity – such as flying, which affects global temperature in various ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Again, different types of offset project will inevitably have different costs – especially given that
                    projects
                    may be chosen not just for the CO2 impacts but for their broader social benefits.
